Im a High School student who is very interested in Fashion and in Software engineering as well as Business and Finance. I have my own fashion magazine line where I style the most current runway pieces from the latest fashion shows as well as design my own looks. I love the color black and only wear it. I have a passion for fashion design and marketing and hope that one day I could start my own fashion label and have my fashion shows broadcasted on Vogue. I also collect limited edition pieces and I also collect bags.
